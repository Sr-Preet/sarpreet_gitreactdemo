The React App captures the userâ€™s name through an input field. When the user enter's his/her name, the entered name is stored using the useState hook. The stored name is then displayed below the input.

Key points:
The useState hook manages the name state.
The handleNameChange function updates the state when the user types in the input field.
The name is displayed if it a non-empty string.
